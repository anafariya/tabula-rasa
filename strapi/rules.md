# Content Creation Guide for Strapi CMS

## Overview

This guide explains how to format medical content for our Strapi CMS system. Follow these exact formatting rules to ensure proper rendering and navigation generation.

## üìã Critical Formatting Rules

### 1. High-Yield Points (Creates Blue Box)

**MUST use exactly:** `## High-Yield Points`

**MUST use:** `‚Ä¢` bullets (not `-` or `*`)

```markdown
## High-Yield Points

‚Ä¢ GDMT for HFrEF includes 4 key medication classes: ACEI/ARB/ARNI, beta-blockers, MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors
‚Ä¢ HFpEF is more common in elderly women with hypertension and is more difficult to treat than HFrEF
‚Ä¢ BNP/NT-proBNP is useful for both diagnosis and prognosis in heart failure
```

### 2. Navigation Structure

```markdown
## Major Section (appears as ‚Ä¢ in navigation)

Content for major section.

### Subsection (appears as ‚ó¶ under major section)

Content for subsection.

#### Minor Heading (content only, not in navigation)
```

### 3. Standard Formatting

```markdown
**Bold text** for medications and key terms
_Italic text_ for medical terminology

‚Ä¢ Main bullet point
‚ó¶ Sub-bullet point

| Parameter | Normal  | Abnormal |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| BP        | <120/80 | >140/90  |
```

## üéØ Essential Characters Reference

| Element     | Character  | Usage                     |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Main bullet | `‚Ä¢`        | All primary bullet points |
| Sub bullet  | `‚ó¶`        | Secondary bullet points   |
| Bold        | `**text**` | Medications, key terms    |
| Italic      | `*text*`   | Medical terminology       |

## ‚úÖ Complete Example

# Heart Failure Clinical Guide


## Overview and Classification

Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the heart's inability to pump sufficient blood to meet the body's metabolic demands. It affects approximately **6.2 million adults** in the United States.

### Classification by Ejection Fraction

| Type      | Ejection Fraction | Alternative Name          | Primary Pathophysiology         |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **HFrEF** | ‚â§40%              | _Systolic heart failure_  | Impaired contractile function   |
| **HFpEF** | ‚â•50%              | _Diastolic heart failure_ | Impaired ventricular relaxation |

## Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)

**HFrEF**, also known as _systolic heart failure_, is defined as heart failure with an ejection fraction **‚â§40%**.

### Clinical Presentation

‚Ä¢ **Dyspnea** (at rest or with exertion)
‚Ä¢ **Orthopnea** and _paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea_
‚Ä¢ **Fatigue** and exercise intolerance
‚Ä¢ **Peripheral edema** and _jugular venous distention_
‚Ä¢ **S3 heart sound** (_ventricular gallop_)

### Diagnostic Approach

‚Ä¢ **Echocardiography**: Confirms reduced EF ‚â§40%, may show ventricular dilation
‚Ä¢ **BNP/NT-proBNP**: Elevated in heart failure
‚Ä¢ **ECG**: May show left ventricular hypertrophy, prior MI, conduction abnormalities
‚Ä¢ **Chest X-ray**: May show cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion

### Management

#### Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT)

‚Ä¢ **ACE inhibitors/ARBs/ARNI**: Reduce mortality and hospitalization
‚Ä¢ **Beta-blockers**: Improve survival and symptoms
‚Ä¢ **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)**: Additional mortality benefit
‚Ä¢ **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Newer agents shown to reduce HF hospitalizations

#### Additional Therapies

‚Ä¢ **Diuretics**: For symptom management of volume overload
‚Ä¢ **Device therapy**:
‚ó¶ Consider **ICD** for primary prevention
‚ó¶ **CRT** for select patients

## Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)

**HFpEF**, also known as _diastolic heart failure_, is defined as heart failure with an ejection fraction **‚â•50%**.

### Clinical Presentation

‚Ä¢ Similar symptoms to **HFrEF**, but often more pronounced with exertion
‚Ä¢ More common in **elderly**, **women**, and those with **hypertension**
‚Ä¢ Often presents with **exercise intolerance** as the predominant symptom
‚Ä¢ **S4 heart sound** (_atrial gallop_) may be present

### Management

‚Ä¢ **Diuretics**: For symptom management of volume overload
‚Ä¢ **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Recent data show benefit in reducing HF hospitalizations
‚Ä¢ **Blood pressure control**: Essential to reduce cardiac afterload
‚Ä¢ **Treatment of comorbidities**: Manage **hypertension**, **diabetes**, **obesity**

## High-Yield Points

‚Ä¢ **GDMT for HFrEF** includes 4 key medication classes: **ACE inhibitors/ARBs/ARNI**, **beta-blockers**, **MRAs**, and **SGLT2 inhibitors**
‚Ä¢ **HFpEF** is more common in elderly women with hypertension and is more difficult to treat than **HFrEF**
‚Ä¢ **BNP/NT-proBNP** is useful for both diagnosis and prognosis in heart failure
‚Ä¢ **NYHA classification** (I-IV) is used to classify heart failure severity based on symptoms
‚Ä¢ Worsening renal function during heart failure treatment may represent _cardiorenal syndrome_

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚Ä¢ **DO NOT** use `-` or `*` for bullets - ONLY use `‚Ä¢`
‚Ä¢ **DO NOT** change "High-Yield Points" phrase - must be exact
‚Ä¢ **DO NOT** skip navigation hierarchy - use ## then ### then ####
‚Ä¢ **DO NOT** forget to bold medications and key medical terms
‚Ä¢ **DO NOT** use numbered lists in place of bullet points

## ‚úÖ Quality Checklist

Before submitting content, verify:

‚Ä¢ High-Yield Points section uses exact phrase with `‚Ä¢` bullets
‚Ä¢ All major sections use `##` for navigation
‚Ä¢ All subsections use `###` for navigation  
‚Ä¢ Medications are **bolded**
‚Ä¢ Medical terminology is _italicized_
‚Ä¢ Bullet points use `‚Ä¢` character consistently
‚Ä¢ Tables are properly formatted with headers
‚Ä¢ Sub-bullets use `‚ó¶` character
